![versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/pybadges.svg)

## Description

This an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Airbnb public data about rental listings in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The aim is to clean the data, explore patterns and visualize our findings and possible insights. 

The data is available [here](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html)
I used the 21 March 2021, listings file to work. 

I removed the Host name beforehand in order to guaranty anonymity while working on the dataset â€” the file only have first names.

## Guiding questions

- Types of rentals avalaible by neighbourhood;
- Distribution of rentals by neighbourhood;
- Price ranges and distributions;
- Average price by type of room and neighbourhood;
- Most popular listings.
 
## Prerequisites & Getting started

<u>None.</u> All libraries and packages used are in the notebook ready to be downloaded:

	* numpy
	* pandas
	* matplotlib
	* seaborn

## Comments

I want to continue to work on some findings and adjust some visualizations which I am not so happy with. Also, there is a lot more to explore in this dataset: text analysis of the descriptions, correlations, etc. I'll continue to update this notebook during my learning process of Python and data analysis.
