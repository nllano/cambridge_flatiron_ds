# Final project: EDA of Airbnb Rio de Janeiro listings (2021)

## Description

This an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Airbnb public data about rental listings in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The aim is to clean the data, explore patterns and visualize our findings and possible insights. 

The data is available [here](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html)
I used the 21 March 2021, listings file to work. 

I removed the Host name beforehand in order to guaranty anonymity while working on the dataset — the file only have first names.

I want to continue to work on some findings and adjust some visualizations which I am not happy with. Also, there is a lot more to explore in this dataset. I'll continue to update this notebook during my learning process of Python and data analysis.
